a simple no-nonsense game teaching traditional values like the expertise of arranging polygons in increasing number of sides


## How to Play?
to specify a move, click the space between polygons, and then press <kbd>Space</kbd> to make that move. the goal is to sort the given polygons by increasing number of sides. if you like working with colors more, the desired order is red-yellow-green-blue-purple, or as a delightful acronym: RYGBP. 

P.S. to reach that goal you can only make certain number of moves, displayed as 'moves left'.
